            <p id="bri_info">Briana is the oldest as well as the only girl.  She is the person I know
            <br>that as a child she did not like chocolate candy or ice cream.  So strange.
            <br>As far back as kindergarten, she has always wanted to be a teacher.  She would
            <br>take workbooks from her class and bring them home and pretend to be a teacher.  Her
            <br>two younger siblings would be her students.  She gets the credit for my oldest son
            <br>Joel's precociousness when he was growing up.  She is now working on an Associate's
            <br>degree in Early Childhood Education.</p>

            <p id="j_info">Joel is a automobile aficianado!  When he talks about cars his
            <br>face lights up like a child on Christmas morning.  I am still amazed
            <br>at how knowlegable he is about automobile, but I'm not surprised.  When Joel was
            <br>a little boy he had just about every Hot Wheels piece there was.  Each time he
            <br>recieved a new one he made sure to flip it over to read the description that was
            <br>engraved on the bottom of the toy car.  For him, it was not an option.  It was
            <br>protocol.  He is now twenty on years old and he still doesn't break protocol.
            <br>Now, however, he makes sure to go online and get all the info on an automobile.</p>
