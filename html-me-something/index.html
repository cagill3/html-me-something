                <p id="bri_info">Briana is my oldest child and the only girl.  She is the only person that
                I know, as a child, that did not like chocolate candy nor ice cream. She prefered orange
                sherbert instead.  So strange!  As far back as kindergarten, she has always wanted to be a
                teacher.  She would take workbooks from her classroom, bring them home and pretend to be a teacher.
                Her two younger brothers would be her students.  She gets the credit for my oldest son's
                precociousness when he was growing up.  She is twenty-five now and working towards her
                degree in Early Childhood Education.</p>

                <p id="j_info">Joel is an automobile aficianado!  When he talks about cars his
                face lights up like a child on Christmas morning.  I am still amazed
                at how knowlegable he is about automobile, but I'm not surprised.  When Joel was
                a little boy he had just about every Hot Wheels car there was.  Whenever he
                would get a new one he made sure to flip it over and read the description that was
                engraved on the bottom of each toy car.  For him, it was not an option...it was
                protocol.  He is now twenty-one years old and he still doesn't break protocol.
                These days he makes sure to go online to get all the info on a particular automobile.</p>

                <p id="jr_info">Carl Jr is the youngest of all three of my children.
                He is the one that is most like me when it comes to what his interests
                are.  He loves to create music and play basketball. He is actually really
                good at both.  While growing up he watched me sit at a
                computer that had a MIDI keyboard connected to it, for hours, as I created music.
                In fact I was pretty good at it myself.  He is so much better at age
                ninteen than I was.  I truly believe that he has the talent
                to be the big time music producer that he wants to be!</p>
