                <p id="bri_info">Briana is the oldest as well as the only girl.  She is the person I know
                <br>that as a child she did not like chocolate candy or ice cream.  So strange.
                <br>As far back as kindergarten, she has always wanted to be a teacher.  She would
                <br>take workbooks from her class and bring them home and pretend to be a teacher.  Her
                <br>two younger siblings would be her students.  She gets the credit for my oldest son
                <br>Joel's precociousness when he was growing up.  She is now working on an Associate's
                <br>degree in Early Childhood Education.</p>

                <p id="j_info">Joel is a automobile aficianado!  When he talks about cars his
                <br>face lights up like a child on Christmas morning.  I am still amazed
                <br>at how knowlegable he is about automobile, but I'm not surprised.  When Joel was
                <br>a little boy he had just about every Hot Wheels piece there was.  Each time he
                <br>recieved a new one he made sure to flip it over to read the description that was
                <br>engraved on the bottom of the toy car.  For him, it was not an option.  It was
                <br>protocol.  He is now twenty on years old and he still doesn't break protocol.
                <br>Now, however, he makes sure to go online and get all the info on an automobile.</p>

                <p id="jr_info">Carl Jr is the youngest of all three of my children.
                <br>He is the one that is most like me when it comes to what his interests
                <br>are.  He loves to create music and he is actually really really
                <br>good at it.  While growing up, he watched me sit at a
                <br>computer and MIDI keyboard for hours recorded music tracks.
                <br>In fact I was pretty good at it myself.  He is way better at age
                <br>ninteen than I was.  I truly believe that he can do has the talent
                <br>to be the big time music producer that he wants to be.</p>
