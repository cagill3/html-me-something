            <p id="bri_info">Briana is the oldest as well as the only girl.  She is the person I know
            <br>that as a child she did not like chocolate candy or ice cream.  So strange.
            <br>As far back as kindergarten, she has always wanted to be a teacher.  She would
            <br>take workbooks from her class and bring them home and pretend to be a teacher.  Her
            <br>two younger siblings would be her students.  She gets the credit for my oldest son
            <br>Joel's precociousness when he was growing up.  She is now working on an Associate's
            <br>degree in Early Childhood Education.</p>
